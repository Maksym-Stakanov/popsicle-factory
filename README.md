# Popsicle Factory Web-Api

This a simple web-api that allows to do basic CRUD operations with Popsicles items.

Web-Api is implemented using .Net 6, CFunctionalExtension, Clear Archtitecture and RESTfull api Design.

In current version all operations can be tested using swagger. No UI WebApps added.

In future UI WebApps that utilize existing Web-Api might be added. WebApps will have similar functionality and interfaces. Each WebApp will be implemented using different frontend framework (such as Razor, Blazor, React, Vue, Angular...)

In current version there is only InMemory version of repository. In future data base and Db version of repositories can be added.
